                    ab eligendi amet qui fuga magni deleniti tenetur tempore repellat 
                    accusamus mollitia. Accusantium, voluptas?n the simplest terms, a software engineer portfolio is 
                    a summary of work you have completed that shows you are a capable software engineer. 
                    It is your landing page, your sales page used to score a job interview or find new clients.
                    We’ll first look for some cool, responsive portfolio design templates online which are 
                    free of cost. The site which I certainly like the most is HTML5up (https://html5up.net/).
                     It has many good choices for a personal portfolio with lots of professional transitions and 
                     CSS/Bootstrap stuff.
